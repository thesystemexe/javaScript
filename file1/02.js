"use strict";

//2
// u can use var to declare any variable and store some information in it
// u can put semi-colon but its not necessary but its good practice

var firstName = "Name"; // declaring the variable using var keyword
firstName = "Name1"; // modifying its value
console.log(firstName); // then printing it

// here u can declare the variable even using the keyword when there is not "use strict"  mode on
secondName = "kurokilla";
console.log(secondName);

secondName = "wtf";
console.log(secondName);

// as u can see the above u r able to declare em without using and when u print them they r still giving the right answer
//lets use "use strict "


// now they r giving error
